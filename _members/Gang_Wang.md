Gang Wang, assistant researcher/Hongshen young teacher at Chongqing University, was selected for the **2022 Humboldt Scholar Program** and **Chongqing Postdoctoral Innovation Talent Support Program**. He graduated with a Ph.D. from the School of Mechanical Science and Engineering of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in December 2021 (under the tutelage of Academician Han Ding and Professor Wenlong Li). His main research directions are robot visual measurement and motion planning, and environmental perception and navigation of intelligent unmanned systems. He presided over the National Natural Science Foundation Youth Fund, the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Special Fund (Station), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation General Project, the Chongqing Postdoctoral Innovation Talent Support Program, etc. He participated in major scientific research projects such as the National 973 Project, the National Foundation Major Research Plan, and the National Foundation Key Project. He served as the guest editor of two consecutive issues of Materials Journal (SCI Q1) and the editorial board member of the Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering Technology. **20 papers** have been published/accepted in JCR Q1 SCI papers and ICRA, IROS and other high-level conference papers **(14 as first author/corresponding author, including 1 ESI highly cited paper)**, 11 of which were published in **IEEE T.Robotics, IEEE/ASME T. Mechatronics, IEEE T. Industrial Informatics** and other top CAS journals in the field of robotics and engineering manufacturing. **Two international invention patents and 14 domestic invention patents have been authorized**. One first prize for scientific and technological progress of the Chinese Automation Society (3/15) has been won.
